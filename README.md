# Pytorch Installers
1. Scripts for installing Pytorch and Torchvision from source for small CUDA CC (Default 3.0) and scripts for installing CUDA 10.1 and CuDNN 7.6.5.
2. Please first install CUDA 10.1 first, then CuDNN, and then Pyroch and Torchvision.
3. I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 and my GPU is GTX 660 with CUDA CC of 3.0 currently working.
4. You can edit the CUDA CC in the file as well as the Pytorch version.
5. The pytorch installation should be in the enviroment folder and if you're using Pycharm then use it's terminal.
6. The CUDA and CuDNN scripts should be in /Downloads/
7. Please note I didn't include Clang installation. If you want to build Clang++ and install it I recommed doing so withou GUI. It demands a lot of RAM and you can do so by pressing CTRL + ALT + F2 at the loging screen.
8. The Pytorch Installer script was completely working. CUDA and CuDNN were not checked since they can take a while and it might mess up the pytorch installation.
